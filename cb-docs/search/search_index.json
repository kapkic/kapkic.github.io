How to define a dataset A dataset is defined with a yaml configuration, and the data files. Any dataset configuration must inlcude a type, name, task(?), files defined. Files need to be configured with type , data type, file path in path , and any columns with their details. Optional fields are: headers . type: dataset name: abalone files: file1: type: csv data: dataframe path: abalone.mixed.numeric.csv headers: true columns: sex: header: Sex type: nominal data: integer labels: - 0 - 1 - 2 ... file2: type: csv data: graph path: causal_info_adjmat.csv headers: true columns: sex: header: Sex type: nominal data: integer ... Model Description : Algorithms written in Python that take in a dataset and execute a particular model. Function : Produce outputs based on the tasks and models. How to define a model A model is defined with a yaml configuration, alongside a python script that the model is executed on. A model must have a type, name, task(?), path, and its inputs and outputs defined. Optional fields are: version_num , that defines the versions, arguments that define any arguments and hyperparameters a model can take. type: model name: tcdf task: discovery path: tcdf.py version_num: 1 arguments: kernel_size: type: int default_value: 4 description: Size of sliding kernel inputs: data: id: data data: dataframe space: id: space data: graph outputs: prediction: id: pred data: graph Metric Description : Python implementations of metric calculations.

Context Description : A configuration that encapsulates a selected set of multiple datasets, models, metrics and hyperparameters. Function : ... How to define a context A context is created with a yaml notation.
